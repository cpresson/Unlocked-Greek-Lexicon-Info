Creating a New Lemma file
-------------------------

A new lemma file can be created from an existing lemma file by following the steps below:

1. Move to the existing lemma file in Door43.
2. Mentally remember the new Strong’s Plus ID.
3. Click the “Raw” option icon.
4. Select every line and then use the Copy feature (pull-down menu or Ctrl-C).
5. Click the Browser Back icon.
6. Click the Files tab and then the contents tab (this will take a while).
7. Click the Blue “New File” button.
8. Paste the contents of the previous file into the area below “<> New File”.
9. In the blank field to the right of “en-ugl / content / ” enter the new Strong’s Plus ID, followed by “/01.md”, e.g. “G45555/01.md” and click Commit Changes.
10. It will take approximately 1 day for this new lemma file to appear in the letter’s toc file, and for the old undefined ID to be removed from the letter’s undefined toc.
